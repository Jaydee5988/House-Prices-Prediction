# House-Prices-Prediction

## Project Overview ##

This project aims to predict home prices based on various features, such as property size, number of bedrooms, condition, and more. Using machine learning, we build a model that accurately estimates home prices, providing valuable insights for real estate professionals and homeowners. The project includes data analysis, feature engineering, model building, and evaluation.

### Files in the Repository ###
- df_train.csv: Training dataset containing historical home prices and their features.
- df_test.csv: Test dataset for making predictions.
- Project Proposal Home Price.docx: Detailed project proposal, outlining objectives, methodology, timeline, and deliverables.
- house_price_prediction.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data analysis, preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.
- README.md: Project description and instructions for replicating the analysis.

### Project Steps ###
1. Data Loading and Preprocessing:

- Load the data and handle missing values by imputing medians for numerical columns and modes for categorical columns.
- Perform encoding and scaling to prepare the data for modeling.
  
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

- Summary statistics and visualizations to understand feature distributions.
- Correlation analysis to identify relationships between features and the target variable (price).

3.Feature Engineering:

- Create additional features based on existing data to improve model accuracy, such as total square footage (TotalSF).
- Identify and retain the most significant features for model training.

4. Model Training and Evaluation:

- Build a pipeline to preprocess the data and train a linear regression model.
- Split the data into training and validation sets for model evaluation.
- Calculate performance metrics (e.g., Mean Squared Error, R^2 Score) to assess model accuracy.

5. Interpretability and Insights:

- Analyze feature importance to identify which features have the most significant impact on price.
- Provide actionable insights for real estate pricing and investment strategies based on model results.

6. Visualization of Predictions:

- Scatter plot of actual vs. predicted prices.
- Residual plot to analyze prediction errors.
- Distribution plot of residuals to assess model error distribution.

### Installation and Requirements ###
To run this project, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Jupyter Notebook
Required libraries:
- Pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn

### Running the Project ###
- Clone the repository and navigate to the project folder.
- Open model_pipeline.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook.
- Run each cell sequentially to perform data analysis, model training, and evaluation.
- Modify parameters and experiment with different models as needed.

### Results and Insights ###
- Model Performance: The model provides a good estimate of home prices with an acceptable error margin (based on Mean Squared Error and R^2 Score).
- Feature Analysis: Key features influencing home prices include property size, condition, and views. These insights can guide real estate investment and marketing strategies.
  
### Future Improvements ###
- Experiment with more complex models (e.g., Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) to improve accuracy.
- Perform hyperparameter tuning for optimal model performance.
- Collect more data to improve model generalizability.
